# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

### 1. LU Decomposition (printing L and U)
Algorithm (4 steps):

Read the matrix A.

Perform LU decomposition of A to obtain P, L, and U.

Extract L (lower-triangular) and U (upper-triangular) matrices.

Display L and U.

### 2. Solving AX = B using LU Decomposition

Algorithm (4 steps):

Read matrices A and B and perform LU decomposition to get P, L, U.

Compute Pb by multiplying Pᵀ with B.

Solve the forward substitution Ly = Pb.

Solve the backward substitution Ux = y and print x

## Program:
